# How to build STAC

To work on STAC (Siri's Trick Attempt Counter) you should follow these steps:

0) Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

1) Clone the repository, e.g. with ```git clone https://github.com/JGC-Sirius/siris-trick-attempt-counter.git```.

2) Load all dependencies with ```git submodule update --init```.

3) Open the project directory in any IDE. I recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea/download/), since you only have to load the .iml file and you are ready to go.

## Libraries used:
